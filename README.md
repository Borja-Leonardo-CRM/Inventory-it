# Inventory-IT

Inventory manager for computer and telecommunications equipments.

This project is part of the second module of Ironhack´s bootcamp - Madrid

The main objective of this application is to facilitate the management and control of telecommunication and computer equipment, by signing a user with the equipment that he will use to carry out his work within an organization.

The application initially has an signin form, if you are a user it takes you directly to the screen of the employees to which they will add their respective equipment and if you are not registered, then it will send you to a registration form to be able to do it.

The application is divided into two tables, the employees and equipment and both can be edited with edit and delete buttoms to modify and delete items.

We use passports for authentication and routing systems for login and signup, flash messages for successes and failures in login and sign up.

A search bar for employees and equipment that took us a lilte bit more time to acomplish that we expected.

The most complicated part was being able to sign each device to a specific user, we used axios so that the calls were ajax and thus being able to have something of Single Page technology on the page.

We whis we could have had some more time to get the CSS part to a higher level and to show the equipment each employee has on he´s, her´s profile instead the reference number.
